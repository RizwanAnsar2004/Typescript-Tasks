// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.

//  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 

// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.

//  Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,

//  such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make 

// sure all the information was stored correctly.
